# HHA 504 - Assignment # 8

This repository represents the completion of HHA 504 Assignment # 8

Instructions:

Please create a new github repo called 'DNS-practice' 

Inside the repo, please create a simple flask app (can be your PssP or something else, I have no preference) - this flask app should then be deployed on a VM in either GCP or Azure 

Register a domain name using .TECH (be sure to have your github student account linked so it is FREE) - or if you have already purchased domains in the past and use something like godaddy, that is also fine [https://get.tech/github-student-developer-pack] 

Create a A record that links together the domain with the IP address of your flask app deployed on either GCP or Azure 

Create a markdown/readme file that contains the following information: 
- The name of your purchased domain 
- A copy of the 'A' record settings that you needed to write (name, value, TTL) 
- The cloud vendor you selected 
- Brief instructions if something were to want to re-recreate your app on their own cloud VM 
- A "/photos" folder that contains screen shots of your live flask application deployed on your website
